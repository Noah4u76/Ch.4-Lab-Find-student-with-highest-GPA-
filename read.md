4.26 LAB: Find student with highest GPA
Complete the Course class by implementing the FindStudentHighestGpa() member function, which returns the Student object with the highest GPA in the course. Assume that no two students have the same highest GPA.

Given classes:

Class Course represents a course, which contains a vector of Student objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here.)
Class Student represents a classroom student, which has three private data members: first name, last name, and GPA. (Hint: GetGPA() returns a student's GPA.)
Note: For testing purposes, different student values will be used.

Ex. For the following students:

Henry Nguyen 3.5
Brenda Stern 2.0
Lynda Robison 3.2
Sonya King 3.9
the output is:

Top student: Sonya King (GPA: 3.9)
